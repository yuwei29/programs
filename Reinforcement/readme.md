"reinforcement" is not a word that I like 
I shall use some other word as the name of this dir 

self-guided evolving?

they aim to build slaves for their benefits 
so it's about they ENFORCE the slaves to do what they need them to do again and again 
so it's about they teach the slaves to LEARN what they want them to adopt 

I aim to build lives that live for themselves

live evolving
